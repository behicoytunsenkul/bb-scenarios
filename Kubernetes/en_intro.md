## 1- What is Kubernetes?
**Kubernetes** is a Container Cluster tool developed by Google using the GO language, supported by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation, that allows you to automatically deploy and manage your existing containerized applications together with operations such as increasing or decreasing their number.
## 2- Why Choose Kubernetes?
Since managing multiple containers can take a lot of time, the kubernetes tool is used to manage them according to defined rules. It also enables horizontal scaling by enabling multiple devices to work together as well as container management.
