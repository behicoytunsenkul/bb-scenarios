### What is Service Mesh?
Before moving on to the training of the Istio software, let's learn what the concept of Service Mesh is, which we will often use:

Service Mesh is an infrastructure used to facilitate communication, monitoring and management of applications with microservice architecture. In other words, it divides an application into independent services, making it more modular and scalable.
We can list the main tasks of Service Mesh as follows:
- Load Balancing
- Security
- monitoring
- Fault Tolerance
- policy

-> Now that we have learned the concept of Service Mesh, we can move on to Istio, which is the basic building block of our training.
