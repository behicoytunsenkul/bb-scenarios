## Python Algorithms-1

  Welcome to our Python Algorithms-1 course. In this lesson, you will be able to improve yourself in the Python language by repeating all that you have learned in our Python Training series.
 
### Course Outcomes
Using -**for** and **while** you will learn how loops can be used together.
You will learn how to receive a command from the user with the -**input** command.
By installing -**function** you will learn how to call the function again.

Before we move on to our lesson, let's create the file where we will write our Python codes by using the following command on the terminal:
```python
vim pythonalgorithm.py
```
After creating our file, let's open the file we created by entering the ``python3 pythonalgorithm.py`` command and move on to the next step.
