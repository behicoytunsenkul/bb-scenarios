# ðŸ”¥ Try Yourself ðŸ”¥
Using the algorithm logic used in our previous step, we get the following output:
```python
*********
 *******
  *****
   ***
    *
```
**Hint:** The units you need to use to get this output above:
-> 4 ``for`` loops

>If you have successfully achieved an output as above, you can proceed to the last step of our training.s
