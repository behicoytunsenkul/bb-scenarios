We have detailed the working principle of the Caesar Cipher Algorithm in the previous step of our tutorial. Now we will test our algorithm:
> To close our file, first press the ```ESC``` key and enter the ```:wq!``` command. Then, we enter the ```python3 ceaserpass.py`` command on the terminal screen in order to run our algorithm.

After running our algorithm, it will first ask us for the key value, that is, the scroll value. We equate this value with **3**. After that, we will be asked to enter the word that we want to be encrypted. Let's enter **software** for the word.
S -> V
O -> R
F -> I
T -> W
W -> Z
A -> D
R -> U
E -> N
The encrypted word was obtained as **vriwzduh** by shifting as .
