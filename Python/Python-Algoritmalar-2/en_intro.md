## Python Algorithms-2
Welcome to our Python Algorithms-2 tutorial. In this tutorial, we will examine an example of medium difficulty, as in our Python Algorithms-1 tutorial. The subject of our example in this lesson is how to write the Caesar Cipher algorithm with Python.
Before we move on to coding our algorithm, let's examine what the Caesar Cipher Algorithm is and how it works:

### ðŸ”’What is Caesar Cipher Algorithm?
Caesar Cipher is the first known encryption technique in history. Caesar Cipher, as the name suggests, was first used by Jul Caesar. The purpose of use is to prevent the messages sent in times of war from being read when captured by the enemy.

### How Does the Caesar Cipher Algorithm Work?
The Caesar Cipher Algorithm, which is a very simple method, is created by shifting the letters according to the determined key value. Let's look at the working logic of the Caesar Cipher Algorithm by making a small example:
Let the word we want to encrypt is ***software***. Let our key value, that is, the letter shift value, be 2. Now, using this information, let's encrypt our word:
Y -> A
A -> C
Z -> B
I -> J
L -> N
I -> J
M -> O
As a result of our operations, our encrypted word appears as **acbjnjo**.
