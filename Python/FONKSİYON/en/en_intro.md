In the 4th lesson of our Python Training series, we will examine what Functions are, why and how it is used:
## 1-What is Function? Why is it used?
Functions are a set of commands created to perform a particular function. For example, the print () function contains certain commands to perform the display. Functions, instead of writing the same job we want to do in the code in multiple code; It is a set of commands that make our job quite easy by doing it at one time.
 **Functions in short**
-Everyone is doing a certain job.
-We can separate two as a function that does not take the function area.
-The task of function is to collect complex processes together and to enable us to do these operations in one step.
-Using function, we can collect the operations of one or more steps under a single name.

Before starting coding, we need to open a file with a '.py' extension where we will enter the code below by entering the Terminal:
```python
vim pythondersi.py
```
