# Functions
### a) Function Identification and Calling Function
The command `` def`` is used to identify function.
```python
def fonksiyon_name(parameter):
    command 1
    command 2
    .
    .
    command n
    return term
```
When defining a function, we use a pattern as above. Using the above function pattern, let's create a simple function on our 'pythondersi.py' file:
```python
def greet(name):
    print('Hello Bulut Bilisimci')
    
greet()
```

After completing the above function, first press the ``ESC`` key to exit the writing mode in our file, then enter the ``: wq!`` Command and exit the file. To run the file we have written, let's run this command below:`
```python
python3 pythondersi.py
```
