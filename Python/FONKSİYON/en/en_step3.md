### c) Sending Information To Return From The Function
Instead of printing information with ``print()`` in the function, we can return the information.
```python
def hello(name):
    return "Hello " + name
print(hello(" Bulut Bilisimci")
```
As you can see above ``print()``, instead of printing the information in the function, we returned the screen with the ``return``.
