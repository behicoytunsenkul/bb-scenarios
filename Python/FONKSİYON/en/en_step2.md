### b) Sending A Parameter To The Function
We can send information to functions from outside and use it in the function:
```python
def hello(name):
    return "Hello "+ name

print(hello("Bulut Bilisimci"))
```
After writing the above function to the file named 'pythondersi.py', you will be able to get the output of the file by running the file as in the previous step:
-->``
Hello Bulut Bilisimci
``
