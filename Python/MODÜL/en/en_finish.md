### 4) Naming Modules
Each module we use is actually the name of the file. Since the file used in the previous step was saved as ``pythonmodules.py``, the module was named ``pythonmodules``. However, as in this example, sometimes module names can be quite long. For this, temporary module naming can be done with the as command:
```python
import pythonmodules as pm
a = pm.person["age"]
print(a)
```
### 5) Frequently Used Modules:
**a) NumPy:** In addition to complex mathematical calculations, multidimensional arrays provide advanced mathematical convenience such as performing calculations on the data stored in them.

**b) Pendulum:** It makes it easier to do more complex encodings involving dates and times. Its operation is more intuitive and it automatically manages time zones.

**c) Tkinter:** It enables the development of applications with Graphical User Interface.

**d) Pandas:** It helps you process and analyze large datasets without having to learn a special data manipulation language like R.
