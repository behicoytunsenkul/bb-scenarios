# Introduction to Assembly Language
Welcome to our Assembly Language tutorial series. In this training series, we will learn the basic structure of assembly language with our lecture and interactive examples.
**If you are ready**, let's start our training by examining what Assembly Language is, why it is used, and how it is used.
### 1- What is Assembly?
Your personal computers have a microprocessor that manages arithmetic, logical and control operations. Each processor cluster has instructions such as taking input from the keyboard, displaying information on the screen, and performing other operations. These instructions are collectively called **Machine Language Instructions**.
Assembly Language is a language developed to overcome the difficulties that may arise from machine language. Assembly, which can be programmed with the binary system, short commands, that is, mnemonics structure is used. In short, assembly language is a shortcut that makes it easier and more understandable to write code with machine language.
### 2- What are the Advantages of Assembly Language?
* It is the only programming language that can best implement what the processor can do.
* Programs written in assembly language are very fast.
* Programs written in other languages, among other languages, have a rather small size.

### 3- What are the Disadvantages of Assembly Language?
* In order to write programs, it is necessary to know the structures of microprocessors.
* Programs written in assembly language differ according to microprocessor types. For example, if a program written for one microprocessor is intended to be used in another microprocessor, the program may not work.
* Assembly language is more difficult and time consuming than other programming high level languages.

-> Now that we have learned the structure and features of assembly language, we can now switch to coding with assembly language.
